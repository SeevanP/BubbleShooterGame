Part of my university project. This a bubble shooter mini game made in SFML-2.6.2

As you can see it has a 120 second timer and you need to beat it within that time 

Has a soothing whale sound in the background for added immersion

Has lose conditions like when all your bubbles reach back to the shooter you automatically lose and the window closes after 5 seconds
